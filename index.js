// Arrays vs Hash Tables

// 1. **Space Usage**:
//    - Arrays use less memory because they only store values.
//    - Hash tables use more memory because they store both keys and values.

// 2. **Access Speed**:
//    - Arrays are fast to access with a constant time O(1) because you know the index.
//    - Hash tables are also typically fast (O(1) on average), but occasional collisions can make them slower in rare cases.

// 3. **Insertion and Deletion**:
//    - Arrays are slow for insertions and deletions (O(n)) because shifting elements may be needed.
//    - Hash tables are fast for insertions and deletions (O(1) on average).

// 4. **Order**:
//    - Arrays are ordered, meaning elements are in a specific sequence.
//    - Hash tables are unordered, so there's no guaranteed order.

// 5. **Duplicates**:
//    - Arrays can contain duplicates easily.
//    - Hash tables can also store duplicates, but handling them may require extra work.

// 6. **Sorting**:
//    - Arrays can be sorted efficiently.
//    - Hash tables are not naturally suited for sorting; you'd need to convert them to an array first.

// 7. **Memory Usage**:
//    - Arrays are memory-efficient when the size is known and fixed.
//    - Hash tables can waste memory if they're significantly larger than the stored elements.

// 8. **Keys vs. Values**:
//    - Arrays only store values.
//    - Hash tables store key-value pairs, useful for mapping relationships.

// 9. **Implementation Complexity**:
//    - Arrays are straightforward to use and implement.
//    - Hash tables require more complex implementation and may introduce bugs if not done correctly.
